# Diabetes Prediction
Analyzing various attributes on which diabetes directly depends and predicting if a person with a given health conditions has diabetes.

## Motivation
Project was created to make a comparison between the accuracy of predictions obtained from Support Vector Machine and Naivebayes algorithm. The goal of the project is to tune the two algorithms in such a way that the accuracy of prediction is maximized.

## Data-set
Data-set being used in this project can be found on kaggle or you can use this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) to go directly to the data-set.
